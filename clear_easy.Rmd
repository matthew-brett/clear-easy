## The notebook

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook.

The notebook allows us to mix text (like this) and code in *chunks* (see below).

You can add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or
by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

Here is a *code chunk*:

```{r}
a <- 10
```

Run the code chunk with the Run arrow at the right of the chunk, or press
*Cmd-Shift-Enter* while the cursor is inside the chunk.

You should now know that you can read the chunk above as "The variable 'a' gets
the value 10."

You can show the result by putting the new variable on a line on its own in a
chunk like this:

```{r}
a
```

Now notice the stuff at the top and the bottom of the code chunk.  The starting
characters that tell the notebook about the start and end of a code chunk are
three *backtick* characters.  Try deleting a backtick in the start and end of
the chunk above and see what happens.  Then put the backtick back, to fix.

Here we look at some summaries of student ratings of teaching.

This is summary data that [Andrew Rosen](https://asrosen.com) downloaded from
<https://www.ratemyprofessors.com> for an analysis he reported in [a 2018
paper](https://asrosen.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/postprint_rmp-1.pdf).
The data file here is from the [supplementary
material](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/suppl/10.1080/02602938.2016.1276155);
it has the average rating across academic discipline for all professors in a
particular discipline who have more than 20 ratings.

Quoting from the paper above:

> Students on RateMyProfessors rate professors based on three main key
> criteria: clarity, helpfulness, and easiness. These criteria are mandatory
> fields when a review is submitted, and the rating scale ranges from 1 to 5 in
> integer increments with 1 being the worst rating and 5 being the best rating.
> Professors are then assigned an overall quality score that is simply the
> average of their clarity and helpfulness scores.

If you want to run this notebook on your laptop, you should download the
[rate_my_course.csv](rate_my_course.csv) file to the same directory as this
notebook.


Now to R. We first load the data from the data file into memory.

```{r}
ratings <- read.csv('rate_my_course.csv')
```

We will see a lot more on this soon, but "ratings" is the name we have given to this *table* of data, in memory.  R calls this table a *data frame*.

Each row of the table (data frame) gives the mean ratings for all professors
in a given discipline; thus there is one row per discipline.

We can ask R for a spreadsheet display of the data with this command:

```{r}
View(ratings)
```

If we don't need the whole spreadsheet view, we can see the first six rows of
this table, with this command:

```{r}
head(ratings)
```

Given the background above, the column names are self-explanatory:

* Discipline
* Number of Professors
* Helpfulness
* Helpfulness
* Overall Quality
* Easiness

Now we might want to explore further.  For example, we might be interested in the distribution of the average scores for Helpfulness.

We called our table (data frame) `ratings`.  Now we want the `Helpfulness` column from this table.  We get a column from the table by using the dollar sign like this: `ratings$Helpfulness`.  This means, "give me the `Helpfulness` column from the `ratings` table.

For example, we can do a *histogram* of the `Helpfulness` column values like this:

```{r}
hist(ratings$Helpfulness)
```

Now your turn.  What command do you think you would need to do histogram of the `Easiness` column of the `ratings` table?  Look at the code chunk above, and then replace the `...` in the code below to do a histogram of the `Easiness` values.

```{r}
hist(...)
```

We might want to some basic statistics on the column values.  For example, to get the mean of the `Helpfulness` column, we could use:

```{r}
mean(ratings$Helpfulness)
```

Maybe we are interested in the standard deviation?

```{r}
sd(ratings$Helpfulness)
```

Now a speculation.  What do you think will be the relationship between the
ratings for `Helpfulness` and the ratings for `Easiness`?  Are they different, and unrelated things?  Would teachers on harder courses be more helpful?   What do you think?

Let's have a look:

```{r}
plot(ratings$Helpfulness, ratings$Easiness)
```

Why might that be?

One way of assessing whether the points are close to a straight line, with a positive or negative slope, is to use *correlation*, to *test* for the relationship:

```{r}
cor.test(ratings$Helpfulness, ratings$Easiness)
```

Now your turn.  What do you think the relationship will be between `Clarity` and `Easiness`?

Use the code above to see if you can work out how to do a plot of the `Clarity` values from the `ratings` table on the x-axis, and the `Easiness` values from the `ratings` table on the y-axis.  Have a look at the plot above to see which one goes first in your `plot` command.

```{r}
plot(...)
```

Now see if you can show the result of the correlation test between the `Clarity` values of `ratings` and the `Easiness` values.

```{r}
...
```
